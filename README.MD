# Asteroids 1979 build

This is a recreation of the classic 1979 game Asteroids
This build was built my Jeremy Atwood followoing along with the video guide created by freeCodeCamp.org
The video that I followed to creat this was the [Code Asteroids in JavaScript (1979 Atari game) - tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9CSWMxJx84&t=4536s)
